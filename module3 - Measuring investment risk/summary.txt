Variability is best measure of risk
 
calculating the standard deviation would tell how much dispertion can occur 
Higher the standard deviation greater the risk

Variance = Measure of dispersion of a set of date points around the mean



-There is a relationship b/w prices of companies, which will help us optimize investemnt portfolios 
 Eg: people can stop buying car but they cant stop buying food from supermarket. 


1 -> perfectly positively correlated
0 -> Neutral
-1 -> perfectly negatively correlated

cor(returns) 	!=	 cor(prices) = they have diff implication
reflects the		focuses on 	
dependence		stock price levels	
b/w prices
at diff times
and focuses on
returns of your 
portfolio

- we should not always multiply by 250 b/c it is done for annual return		

Till now we saw portfolio rate of return
portfolio variance not calculated yet
so:
portfolio is the combination of many stocks so we need to calculate variance (see portfolio_variance.jpg) the formula would slightly be different.
if a portfolio contains 2 or more stocks then the its risk(variance) would be correlation b/w the 2 stocks and variance of the 2 stocks

-Systematic/un-diversifiable risk -> component depends on the variance of each individual security. It is also known as systematic risk
There are number of systematic risk that cannot be diversified Eg: recession of economy, low consumer spending, wars, forces of nature etc.
-Idiosyncratic/Diversifiable risk -> also known as company specific risk. Driven by company-specific event
Diversifiable risk can be eliminated if we invest in non-correlated assets. Eg: automotive, construction, energy, tech etc.
Investemnet vehicles tracking indices like S&P 500 are well diversified. The only risk they are exposed to is systematic risk
Some institutional investors go even further and try to build portfolios of securities from different countries which further reduces the correlation

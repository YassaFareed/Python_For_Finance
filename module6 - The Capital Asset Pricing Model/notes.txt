The market portfolio:
Superior risk return and optimal in terms of risk
A combination of all possible investment in the world

CAPM assumes the existence of risk-free asset. An investment with 0 risk. (we will invest no matter we got low return)

The risk-free asset: (ZERO RISK AND LOWER RETURN)
Why should we assume the risk-free rate has a lower expected rate of return?
In efficient markets, investors are only compensated for the added risk they are willing to bear

Investors will allocate their money b/w the risk-free and market portfolio

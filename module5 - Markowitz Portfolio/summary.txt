Markowitz proved the existence of an efficient set of protfolios. (check calculations in excel file)

The combination of securities with little correlation allows investors 
to optimize their retruns without assuming additional risk
Diversified portfolio: higher returns, No additional risk

0.3 correlation is far from 1, and we can benefit from diversification effect

Lower the correaltion coeff greater the diversification affect that combination of 2 stocks will have

There is a set of eff portfolios that can provide a higher expected rate of return for same or even
lower risk. This group of portfolios are called efficicent frontier. 

Points below efficient frontier represent inefficient portfolios as for each we can find an alternative
portfolios with same stand dev and greater returns!!!

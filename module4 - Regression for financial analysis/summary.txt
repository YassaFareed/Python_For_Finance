- We use variance as the measure of varaiablity 
- Total sum of squares (TSS) provides a sense of variability of data  (TSS = E(x-~x)^2)
- SSR is the sum of squared residual to obtain regression coeff (best fitting line minimizes sum of squared residuals) -> The coefficients found with this technque is called OLS estimates
Y = alpha + beta x + error

total sum of squares (TSS)
R^2 = 1 - ssr/tss  (can range b/w 0 to 100%)

OLS 



1st table
If r^2 > 30% it is explaining more (good explainatory power) => 0.677 house size can explain 68% of the house prices

2nd table
const first row => c
second row first col => it is gradient/slope, on the right its std error
